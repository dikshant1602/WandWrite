## WandWrite App
WandWrite is my first-ever **SwiftUI** app, where users can **download notes, join groups, and comment** on shared content. I built this project to learn **iOS development** and understand how **Firebase** can be used as a backend for real-time data storage and authentication.  

# Project Overview  
WandWrite is a simple **note-sharing and discussion platform** where users can:  
- Download Notes – Access and save shared study materials  
- Join Groups– Connect with like-minded learners  
- Comment & Discuss – Share thoughts and engage in discussions  

## Technologies Used  
- SwiftUI – For building the user interface  
- Firebase – For authentication, real-time database, and storage  
- Firestore – To store and manage user-generated content  
- Swift Package Manager (SPM) – For managing dependencies  

## What I Learned  
- Basics of SwiftUI and building UI components  
- Using Firebase Authentication for user login/signup  
- Implementing Firestore for real-time data updates  
- Handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Firestore  
- Managing app state and navigation in SwiftUI
